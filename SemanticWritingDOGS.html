        <h1><strong>You said DOGS? Here are 10 facts about them!</strong></h1>

        <h2><i>1.Their sense of smell is at least 40x better than ours</i></h2>
        <img src="Dogs.webp" width="500" height="500"/>
        <p>The area of cells in the brain that detect different smells is around 40 times larger in dogs than humans. 
            This means that your dog can pick up on way more smells than we ever could. 
            This is why dogs are often used to sniff out people, drugs and even money!</p>
            
        <h2><i>2.Some have such good noses they can sniff out medical problems</i></h2>
        <img src="Live.jpg" width="500" height="500"/>  
        <p>Yup, medical detection dogs are a thing. Because their sense of smell is so great, some dogs can be trained to sniff out medical conditions. 
            They are used to diagnose a particular condition or to alert their owners if they need more medication. 
            Some are even being trained to sniff out Covid-19!</p>

        <h2><i>3.Dogs can sniff at the same time as breathing</i></h2>
        <img src="GrassDog.jpg" width="500" height="500" />
        <p>Dogs rely a lot on their sense of smell to find food, potential dangers, and friends, so needless to say they sniff a lot. 
            Their noses are designed so smells can stay in their nose while air can move in and out of their lungs at the same time, 
            which means they can breathe freely and still work out what that smell is!</p>

        <h2><i>4.Some dogs are incredible swimmers</i></h2>
        <img src="Dogs.webp" width="500" height="500"/>
        <p>So, not all dogs like water, but the ones that do tend to be pretty good swimmers 
            (but again, not all are so always keep an eye on your dog in case they decide to take a dip out and about).
            Newfoundlands are so good in the water that for years they’ve been used as water rescue dogs. In 2016, 
            a brave Newfoundland called Whizz was awarded the PDSA Order of Merit for saving nine people from the sea over his career as a water rescue dog.</p>

        <h2><i>5.Some are fast and could even beat a cheetah!</i></h2>
        <img src="AutumnDog.jpg" width="500" height="500"/>
        <p>‘But how does this beat a cheetah?’ we hear you ask. Well, while a cheetah can get up to almost 70mph, they can only keep this going for around 30 seconds. 
            Greyhounds, on the other hand, could easily run at speeds in excess of 35mph for seven miles. 
            So despite the cheetah’s head start, they’d soon overtake!</p>
